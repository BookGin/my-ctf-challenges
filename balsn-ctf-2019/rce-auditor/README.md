The internal server listening on `localhost:6666` will read from inputs and execute in shell line by line. However, Chromium (and Firefox) will [block any access to port 6666](https://superuser.com/a/188070) due to `ERR_UNSAFE_PORT`. It's designed to protect users from protocol smuggling attacks. 

Thus, HTTP-based request (XHR/fetch/html) will fail to be sent. We have to leverage other protocols. Though Chromium supports `ftp`, it's too difficult to abuse `ftp` for protocol smuggling.

Nowadays, modern browser supports [WebRTC API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebRTC_API). This API aims for establishing peer-to-peer connection. During the negotiation, [STUN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STUN) protocol is used to pick up [ICE candidates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interactive_Connectivity_Establishment).

However, it's not trivial.

Specifying username and password in initializing WebRTC TURN server will not work, because the TURN handshake has considered this protocol smuggling attack. 

1. Though username and password is controllable, it's not the first packet sent from the browser.
2. Unless the browser receives a valid response, it will not send this authentication packet containing username and password.
3. We cannot control any byte in the first handshake packet.

STUN server will not work either. The reason is the same as below.

Thus, we have to first establish a valid STUN protocol, and then somehow send the packet to our target. The exploit utilizes ICE candidate and `ice-ufrag` (or `ice-pwd`) in [RFC 5245](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5245) to control part of the packet. `ice-ufrag` and `ice-pwd` are used for authentication to an ICE candidate server.

For full exploit, please see `exploit` directory.


## Postscript

The behavior of blocking unsafe port is interesting. One day I created a test Python server on `0.0.0.0:6666`, I found that the browser itself blocked me from accessing.

For WebRTC part, [it begins to follow CSP connect-src policies](https://github.com/w3c/webrtc-nv-use-cases/issues/35) recently. (This is [one of the challenge in RCTF](https://github.com/zsxsoft/my-ctf-challenges/tree/master/rctf2019/jail%20%26%20password#jail)) Then I notice that STUN protocol is not a HTTP protocol. Can we abuse this for something? This challenge just combines the two idea.
